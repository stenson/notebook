 ### Future
 So for now, Los Angeles is home (the background
     of this site is the upward view from our driveway),
     and we’ve decided to get married. Yes, we’ve
     been engaged for over a year now, and we’ve
     been cohabitating for over 5 years, and dating
     for almost 9. But there’s no time like the
     present!
 So, here are the deets:
 - _The day_ —  June 25, 2016
 - _The venue_ — The Carondelet House, Los
 Angeles, CA
 On the 24th, Brit & Kate will be hosting
     a Rehearsal Dinner at the Fig House in Los
     Angeles. Given that over 90% of all you wedding
     guests are non-Angelenos, you’re also all
     invited to that soiree — a more casual affair,
     complete with an accordion & clarinet duo,
     arranged in honor of the music once heard
     at Brit & Kate’s own wedding (not their idea;
     Rob’s idea).

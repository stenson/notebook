Not the peanut-based dip we enjoy with our Southeast Asian meat skewers, this Teoswa sa-de is darker, oilier, and funkier thanks to dried seafood, chilis, and shallots. Origin myths include the introduction of a similar sauce by overseas Teoswa returning to their hometown, and subsequent adaptation of the sa-de to local tastes.  You may find it as a dipping sauce option at a Chinese hotpot restaurant, or as a tableside condiment if you are lucky to live close to a Teoswa noodle soup restaurant. The most popular brand of sa-de sauce is Bull Head (of Taiwan), which labels its silver cans “BBQ Sauce.” As this misnomer might suggest, sa-de is often served alongside meats, especially beef. </span></p><div class="spacer"></div><p class="c0"><span>The sauce’s deep savoriness and common pairing with </span><span>beef</span><span> made me wonder how it would fare in pasta Bolognese, one of the world’s great comfort foods. Turns out the two harmonize extremely well. The resulting sauce looks and initially tastes like a typical ragù Bolognese, but then you feel a </span><span>slight</span><span> tingle on your tongue from the chilis and Sichuan pepper, and the hints of coconut and dried shrimp in the sa-de beckon your mind to warmer climes.</span></p></div><div class="tilde">～</div><div id="tips-container"><div id="sidebar"><div class="sidebar-image"><div class="sidebar-image-img" style="background-image:url(PADV5A2n.jpg)"></div><div class="sidebar-image-caption">A can of Bullhead Sa-de sauce from Taiwan</div></div></div><div id="tips"><p class="c0"><span>I recommend using fresh flat rice noodles, which can be found unrefrigerated in well-trafficked Asian supermarkets. 2-lb. packs are common, and will feed around 3-4, depending on how hungry your guests are. The lightness of the slippery rice noodles are a lovely contrast to the substantial ragù, and the flurry of fresh herbs to finish helps balance the sauce’s deeper flavors. If you can’t find fresh rice noodles, substitute dried rice noodles or pasta, depending on personal preference (or mood!). </span></p><div class="spacer"></div><p class="c0"><span>Chinese celery is more intensely flavored than Western celery, and the leaves are used in addition to the stalks. The stalks are often sold with a fair amount of trapped grit — make sure to wash thoroughly! (I trim the ends, cut the long stalks into sections, and swish the stalks and leaves in a large bowl of water at least twice.) Western celery is a perfectly fine substitution. Use more or less based on your fondness for the flavor (I use a quite a bit).</span></p></div></div></div><div class="split"></div><div class="bottom clearfix"><div id="ingredients"><p class="c0"><strong>2</strong><span> </span><em>tbsp</em><span> cooking oil</span></p><p class="c0"><strong>3</strong><span> shallots, minced</span></p><p class="c0"><strong>3</strong><span> </span><em>cloves </em><span>garlic</span><span>, minced</span></p><p class="c0"><strong>A few</strong><span> </span><em>stalks</em><span> of Chinese celery, finely chopped (including leaves)</span></p><p class="c0"><strong>1</strong><span> carrot, diced</span></p><p class="c0"><strong>3</strong><em> tbsp or more</em><span> sa-de sauce, to taste</span></p><p class="c0"><strong>1</strong><span> </span><em>lb</em><span> ground beef</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Shaoxing rice wine</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Fish sauce</span></p><p class="c0"><strong>A few</strong><span> </span><em>leaves</em><span> of basil (sweet or Thai, your preference)</span></p><p class="c0"><strong>1</strong><span> </span><em>28-oz can</em><span> whole tomatoes</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Salt</span></p><p class="c0"><span>White pepper</span></p><div class="spacer"></div><p class="c0"><strong>1</strong><span> </span><em>2-lb. pack</em><span> of fresh flat rice noodles</span></p><div class="spacer"></div><p class="c0"><span>Cilantro, chopped</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Basil, chiffonade</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Mint, chiffonade</span></p></div><div id="instructions"><p class="c0"><span>Heat oil in large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>Add shallots and garlic.

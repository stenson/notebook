Not the peanut-based dip we enjoy with our Southeast Asian meat skewers, this Teoswa sa-de is darker, oilier, and funkier thanks to dried seafood, chilis, and shallots. Origin myths include the introduction of a similar sauce by overseas Teoswa returning to their hometown, and subsequent adaptation of the sa-de to local tastes.  You may find it as a dipping sauce option at a Chinese hotpot restaurant, or as a tableside condiment if you are lucky to live close to a Teoswa noodle soup restaurant. The most popular brand of sa-de sauce is Bull Head (of Taiwan), which labels its silver cans “BBQ Sauce.” As this misnomer might suggest, sa-de is often served alongside meats, especially beef. </span></p><div class="spacer"></div><p class="c4"><span>The sauce’s deep savoriness and common pairing with </span><span>beef</span><span> made me wonder how it would fare in pasta Bolognese, one of the world’s great comfort foods. Turns out the two harmonize extremely well. The resulting sauce looks and initially tastes like a typical ragù Bolognese, but then you feel a </span><span>slight</span><span class="c1"> tingle on your tongue from the chilis and Sichuan pepper, and the hints of coconut and dried shrimp in the sa-de beckon your mind to warmer climes.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="post-preview recipe"><div class="post-preview-inner"><a href="/recipes/basil-cockles"><h3>stir-fried basil cockles</h3></a><div><p class="c0"><span>On the afternoon of our first day in Swatow, my aunts — </span><em>d</em><em>à gūgū</em><span> <span class="cjk">大姑姑</span> and </span><em>èr gūgū</em><span> <span class="cjk">二姑姑</span> </span><span class="c3">— met us at our hotel and walked us around a few corners until we found a wet market. The whole place, casual and crowded, teemed with colors and species you’d be lucky to find at any seafood market in America. Each vendor stood guard over styrofoam buckets of seafood that splished and splashed, a showcase of freshness. But almost immediately our eyes fell on a basket of tiny clams, each little oval no larger than a fingertip. My aunts saw our eyes light up and struck up a Teoswa conversation with the vendor.</span></p><div class="spacer"></div><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Soon they had a bagful of “thin shell” clams. “We stir-fry these with basil,” they said. And in a few hours, they showed us how. Their simple preparation omits sauces and instead showcases the natural flavors of the clams and basil.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="post-preview recipe"><div class="post-preview-inner"><a href="/recipes/bak-kut-teh"><h3>bak kut teh // meat bone soup</h3></a><div><p class="c0"><span class="c4">There are many variations on bak kut teh, or “meat bone tea,” but the two main camps are 1) the Teochew version, heavy on white pepper, that is often associated with Singapore, and 2) the darker Hokkien version, brewed with a range of medicinal herbs and spices, that is more popular in Malaysia. Confusingly, the Hokkienese term “bak kut teh” has come to define both versions in the Chinese diaspora of Southeast Asia (in Teochew, this dish sounds more like “neh gu deh”). </span></p><div class="spacer"></div><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Bak kut teh is near infinitely customizable. This recipe is a stripped down version that really highlights the foundational flavors of the Teochew version. Don’t be scared off by the quantity of garlic and peppercorns; their bite is tamed by a long simmer. If you’d like, you can add some dried shiitake mushroom to infuse the broth, or top the finished soup with sliced scallions or chopped cilantro. As for me, I find beauty in the simplicity of this recipe. With so few ingredients, the details are important: salting the ribs ahead of time ensures a tender texture and better flavor; toasting the white peppercorns rounds out the sharper, more pungent notes; and initially blanching the ribs results in a cleaner broth. </span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="drawings"><div id="drawings-inner"></div></div></div><div id="footer-container"><div id="footer"><p>Copyright © 2016 by </p><p style="margin-top:6px">Diana <span class="cn">丹霞</span> Zheng& Rob <span class="cn">萝卜</span> Stenson</p><p class="rights">All rights reserved</p></div></div></div><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js?n=1494090937" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="jquery.color.min.js?n=1494090937" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>

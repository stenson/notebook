Intriguing!</p><figure style="max-width:700px"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UPnOR1ro7FC05YO0430JdNcqY8fNgPCiMrzyu0O0-PurKWhQvWAQNGOUNSBWH6-SPpp8S8Cl3Zabrs4y2yR433q2k0rM5teVpygU4tJ-aPckJj8XOp_tc_bQ0H7omSBlQ?c=57377990" /></figure><p class="classic hyphenate">I was introduced to dried honey dates only a few years ago, while searching for ways to oomph a basic pork broth, the springboard for many Chinese soups. Over the years, I had brewed many batches of underwhelming pork infusions. Clearly my technique was off. The first culprit I identified was my pork bone/scraps:water ratio. I really wanted to get more out of each potful of broth, but it was very obviously backfiring.</p><p class="classic hyphenate tip"><strong class="inlined">Lesson #1:</strong> don't push your ingredients to strive! As with certain people, asking a pork bone to give 110% is just not motivational--and only leaves you crying into a sad bowl of weak pork-water.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">But even after reducing my water levels, something was missing. I always threw in some basic aromatics — ginger, scallions, maybe some peppercorns or other spices--but there was no depth to my pork broth's character. A Google search returned a few ideas, including adding in the mellifluously named "honey date." In the Asian grocery, I found these dried fruits packaged about 20 to a bag in the Chinese herb aisle, and also saw a few included in various soup-mix herb packs. </p><figure style="max-width:700px"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ezJ5hp0V28Qs93hC0Ye93PQzk1GhJIsFU4ACiwSfTlLkxL1wn3jQZ2TjlDTkE15hPH5KacmFyXcpg6UvNo9jVc9J7RIpmGbuCcNWFR1D3teQQAlSnGNM4rmQ8yVUmzCq9A?c=75931014" /></figure><p class="classic hyphenate">They have a satisfying heft to them (unlike the more ubiquitous red dried dates, which are dainty things) and are covered in a fine film of sugar crust. A sniff reveals a turnip-y sulfurous-y undertone, which mellows quite nicely in the pot and provides some much-needed bass to an otherwise one-dimensional broth. Brewed by itself, it has a bit of a mushroomy flavor.</p><p class="classic hyphenate tip"><strong class="inlined">Lesson #2:</strong> a little stank is your friend, my friend.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">It appears that the honey date's name refers to its preparation method rather than its cultivar. One of the Chinese herb & spice guides on my shelf — Terry Tan’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9814561290/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=9814561290&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swatpant-20&amp;linkId=544XZ5IOV7ZQQF4U" target="_blank">Little Guide Book</a> — introduces honey dates simply as a “third variety”; red and black dates are one and two. In Grace Young’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684847396/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0684847396&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=swatpant-20&amp;linkId=TLRCL5UCZQORBAT2" target="_blank">Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen</a>, they also go by “brown dates.” But, most informatively, Teresa M.

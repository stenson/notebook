Hmm. Intriguing!</p><p class="classic hyphenate">I was introduced to dried honey dates only a few years ago, while searching for ways to oomph a basic pork broth, the springboard for many Chinese soups. Over the years, I had brewed many batches of underwhelming pork infusions. Clearly my technique was off. The first culprit I identified was my pork bone/scraps:water ratio. I really wanted to get more out of each potful of broth, but it was very obviously backfiring.</p><p class="classic hyphenate tip"><strong class="inlined">Lesson #1:</strong> don't push your ingredients to strive! As with certain people, asking a pork bone to give 110% is just not motivating--and only leaves you crying into a sad bowl of weak pork-water.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">But even after reducing my water levels, something was missing. I always threw in some basic aromatics--ginger, scallions, maybe some peppercorns or other spices--but there was no depth to my pork broth's character. A Google search returned a few ideas, including adding in the mellifluously named "honey date." In the Asian grocery, I found these dried fruits packaged about 20 to a bag in the Chinese herb aisle, and also saw a few included in various soup-mix herb packs. They have a satisfying heft to them <span class="parenthesis">(</span><span class="parenthetical">unlike the more ubiquitous red dried dates, which are dainty things</span><span class="parenthesis">)</span> and are covered in a fine film of sugar crust. A sniff reveals a turnip-y sulfurous-y undertone, which mellows quite nicely in the pot and provides some much-needed bass to an otherwise one-dimensional broth. Brewed by itself, it has a bit of a mushroomy flavor.</p><p class="classic hyphenate tip"><strong class="inlined">Lesson #2:</strong> a little stank is your friend, my friend.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">It appears that the honey date's name refers to its preparation method rather than its cultivar. One of the Chinese herb/spice guides on my shelf simply introduces it as a "third variety," after the red and black dates <span class="parenthesis">(</span><span class="parenthetical">Tan, 2014 -- Little Guide Book</span><span class="parenthesis">)</span>. In Grace Young's Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen, they also go by "brown dates."

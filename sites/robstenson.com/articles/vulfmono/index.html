Next thing you know the type man is sketching on marker paper, is pulling on Bezier control points, is Superpolating a screenful of glyphs until, there it is, a typeface has come to life and <span class="alt alt-2">it looks a lot like how a saxophone solo sounds</span>.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">The type man is wearing a light sweater and can see the San Francisco fog pass across his office window. He attaches a pdf specimen to an email, sends it. Down the coast, in Los Angeles, the record man is wearing a t-shirt and athletic shorts. From his standing desk he can see a palm tree curve across the sky. He opens the pdf attachment and responds immediately, enthusiastically, with five unspaced <em class="inlined">o</em>’s.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">“ooooo,” he writes as he makes the sound out loud.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">We should step back for a moment.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">There’s a third person in this story, and potentially a fourth or fifth, but we should think about them as a single person, since they all hail from a past era and all worked for a single corporation, IBM, where they all labored together on a typeface for a typewriter. The typewriter was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM%5FSelectric%5Ftypewriter" target="_blank">Selectric</a>, an icon of American desks in the 60s and 70s. The typeface was <em class="inlined">Light Italic</em> — an inappropriate name for a typeface, given that it’s two adjacent adjectives, neither of which tell a story or make a point. But, yes, the typeface is <em class="inlined">light</em> and <em class="inlined">italic</em>.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">If you owned a Selectric typewriter and saw that typeface in a catalog sometime in the 60s or 70s, then you ordered up what they used to call a “golf ball,” which you plopped into the Selectric and <span class="alt alt-1">bang!</span> you had a new typeface to play with, new forms to make writing feel novel again.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">Here’s a picture of one in action (in very slow slo-mo), so you can get a sense of what I’m talking about.</p><figure><img src="img/golfball.gif?c=61575539" /></figure><p class="classic hyphenate">So one day the type man — his name is James Edmondson, of <a href="ohnotype.co" target="_blank">OH no Type Co</a> — one day he gets an email from the record man, Jack Stratton, of <a href="vulf.de" target="_blank">Vulf Records</a>, about how the two of them, even though they’ve never met, the two of them should collaborate on a typeface. The emails says that the typeface should be called <strong class="inlined">vulf mono</strong>. The emails says that it should be based on the classic <em class="inlined">Light Italic</em> of Selectric days.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">Edmondson agrees immediately (he’s a big fan of <a href="http://vulfpeck.com" target="_blank">Vulfpeck</a>, Stratton’s band). So the next day James heads to SFMOMA, to look at an exhibit and what do you know the Selectric and its faces are there, too. This is when he spots it, mounted on the wall like an extinct insect, a golfball of <em class="inlined">Light Italic</em>.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">But Edmondson knows something Stratton doesn’t: you can’t just pull the ball off the wall and trace its forms and say, <em class="inlined">ok, here’s a digital revival of this old analog typeface.</em></p><p class="classic hyphenate">Back in the 60s and 70s, when you sat down at a Selectric and hammered out a phrase like <span class="alt alt-2">vulf</span>, each time you hit a letter the golfball rotated instantaneously and impressed the chosen letter upon the page: <strong class="inlined">v</strong> <strong class="inlined">u</strong> <strong class="inlined">l</strong> <strong class="inlined">f</strong>. But because the Selectric was imperfect, it did more than that: each strike, as Edmondson puts it, “left a unique and subtlety unpredictable shape on the page.” Not what the Selectric engineers wanted, of course; they would’ve seen that as a side effect. But today we cherish it.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">The side effect has become a vibe.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">But digital is so often vibeless, at least at first. If you trace the Light Italic forms literally, you lose what Edmondson calls “warmth.” Somehow (and this is where things get interesting), Edmondson had to warm up the vectors.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">Well, actually, Stratton would understand completely. When he listens to music, he listens to albums whose recording contracts were most likely first clacked out on Selectrics in offices in Hollywood. That is, Stratton looks to the past, to the 60s and 70s, but when he makes music, he uses digital tools to revive analog sensibilities. But, again, <em class="inlined">revive</em> is the wrong word. <em class="inlined">Renew</em> — that’s closer. After all, what Stratton and Edmondson end up with isn’t something that once existed. It’s something that never existed, and — this time — it’s better.</p></div></div></div></body></html>

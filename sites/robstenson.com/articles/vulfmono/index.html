Next thing you know the type man is sketching in a moleskine, is pulling on Bezier control points, is superpolating a screenful of glyphs until, there it is, a typeface has come to life and <span class="alt alt-2">it looks a lot like how a saxophone solo sounds</span>.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">The type man is wearing a light sweater and can see the San Francisco fog pass across his office window. He attaches a pdf specimen, sends an email. Down the coast, in Los Angeles, the record man is wearing a t-shirt and athletic shorts and he can see a palm tree curve across the sky. He opens the pdf attachment and responds immediately, enthusiastically, with five unspaced <em class="inlined">o</em>’s.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">“ooooo,” he writes as he makes the sound out loud.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">But I should step back for a moment.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">There’s a third person in this story, and potentially a fourth or fifth, but they all hail from a past era and all worked for a single corporation, IBM, where they all labored together on a typeface for a typewriter. The typewriter was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM%5FSelectric%5Ftypewriter" target="_blank">Selectric</a>, an icon of American desks in the 60s and 70s, and the typeface was <em class="inlined">Light Italic</em> — an inappropriate name for a typeface, given that it’s two adjacent adjectives, neither of which tell a story or make a point. But, yes, the typeface is <em class="inlined">light</em> and <em class="inlined">italic</em>.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">If you owned a Selectric typewriter and saw that typeface in a catalog sometime in the 60s or 70s, then you ordered up what they used to call a “golf ball,” which you plopped into the Selectric and <span class="alt alt-1">bang!</span> you had a new typeface to play with, new forms to make writing feel novel again.</p><p class="classic hyphenate">Here’s a picture of one in action (in very slow slo-mo), so you can get a sense of what I’m talking about.</p><figure><img src="img/golfball.gif?c=73486415" /></figure></div></div></div></body></html>

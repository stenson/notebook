__What a time to be alive!__ The CEO of a one-man record label sends an unpunctuated email to the CEO of a one-man type foundry. _i’ve been thinking about a vulf font_, writes the record man. Next thing you know the type man is sketching in a moleskine, is pulling on Bezier control points, is superpolating a screenful of glyphs until, there it is, a typeface has come to life and ||it looks a lot like how a saxophone solo sounds||.

The type man is wearing a light sweater and can see the San Francisco fog pass across his office window. He attaches a pdf specimen, sends an email. Down the coast, in Los Angeles, the record man is wearing a t-shirt and athletic shorts and he can see a palm tree curve across the sky. He opens the pdf attachment and responds immediately, enthusiastically, with five unspaced _o_’s.

“ooooo,” he writes as he makes the sound out loud.

But I should step back for a moment.

There’s a third person in this story, and potentially a fourth or fifth, but they all hail from a past era and all worked for a single corporation, IBM, where they all labored together on a typeface for a typewriter. The typewriter was the [Selectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM%5FSelectric%5Ftypewriter), an icon of American desks in the 60s and 70s, and the typeface was _Light Italic_ — an inappropriate name for a typeface, given that it’s two adjacent adjectives, neither of which tell a story or make a point. But, yes, the typeface is _light_ and _italic_.

If you owned a Selectric typewriter and saw that typeface in a catalog sometime in the 60s or 70s, then you ordered up what they used to call a “golf ball,” which you plopped into the Selectric and |bang!| you had a new typeface to play with, new forms to make writing feel novel again.

Here’s a picture of one in action (in very slow slo-mo), so you can get a sense of what I’m talking about.

### A Short Guide to Los Angeles

Los Angeles is _yuge_ and, fittingly, you can find many comprehensive guides on what to see and do here. Yes, there are the beaches and world-class museums and Hollywood and many scenic drives/hikes through the city's hills and canyons… but! Rob & I call Northeast LA home, and since many of you will be spending time around here for wedding festivities, we thought we’d highlight some of our favorite spots in the eastern portion of LA, as well as Pasadena, and the San Gabriel Valley. So here you have it: a short list of spots that make us love this sprawling jumble of a global megalopolis.

Also, for those of you who are looking for guides, here are some relatively recent ones:

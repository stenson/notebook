   "So for now, Los Angeles is home (the background
    of this site is the upward view from our driveway),
    and we’ve decided to get married. Yes, we’ve
    been engaged for over a year now, and we’ve
    been cohabitating for over 5 years, and dating
    for almost 9. But there’s no time like the
    present!"
   "So, here are the deets:"
   "- _The day_ —  June 25, 2016"
   "- _The venue_ — The Carondelet House, Los\nAngeles, CA"
   "On the 24th, Brit & Kate will be hosting
    a Rehearsal Dinner at the Fig House in Los
    Angeles. Given that over 90% of all you wedding
    guests are non-Angelenos, you’re also all
    invited to that soiree — a more casual affair,
    complete with an accordion & clarinet duo,
    arranged in honor of the music once heard
    at Brit & Kate’s own wedding (not their idea;
    Rob’s idea)."
